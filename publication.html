      <td>Dzongkha to English translation using the neural machine translation approach</td>
      <td>In this era of technology, a communication barrier is a thing of the past. With each passing day, different types of language-based applications are being launched. There are 109 official languages Google has translated to date. However, the Dzongkha translation has not been studied. The purpose of this paper was to study Dzongkha to English translation. The parallel corpus was collected from the Dzongkha development commission of Bhutan. The dataset consisted of 53018 sentence pairs. Unique words in Dzongkha and English were 13,393 and 12,506 respectively. Different neural machine translation models were implemented. The experimental results show that the bleu score of Seq2Seq models followed a fluctuating trend. However, the bleu score of the transformer model increases gradually. It was observed that the transformer outperformed the Seq2Seq models. The highest accuracy and the lowest training loss obtained were 84.46% and 0.014858 respectively with a bleu score of 64.89. </td>

      <td>English speaking among the youth is gaining popularity in Bhutan. The Ministry of Education and Dzongkha Development Commission have been trying to promote the national language through different strategies. Furthermore, developed interesting learning materials in Dzongkha. However, youth find it difficult even to name common fruits and vegetables in Dzongkha, and this is an increasing concern. The purpose of this study was to develop an automatic fruit recognition system in Dzongkha using machine learning techniques. Ten classes of fruits and 17 classes of veg- etables that are found in Bhutan are considered for the study. The fruits and vegetable datasets were downloaded from Kaggle and Websites. Furthermore, images were augmented and rotated every 15 degrees. The dataset comprised 405000 images. The model was trained and deployed using customized VGGNet and Gradio. The training and vali- dation accuracy of the proposed model was 97.76% and 97.80% respectively. </td>

      <td>Dzongkha Next Words Prediction Using Bidirectional LSTM</td>
      <td>Dzongkha  Development  Commission  of  Bhutan  (DDC)  is  trying  to computerize  Dzongkha.  However,  the  computerization  of  Dzongkha poses  numerous  challenges.  Currently,  the  support  for  Dzongkha  in modern technology is limited to printing, typing, and storage. Typewriting a single Dzongkha word requires several keypresses. As a result, typing Dzongkha  is  tedious.  In  this  paper,  the  Dzongkha  word  label  prediction was studied. The purpose of the study was to further reduce keystrokes and  make  Dzongkha  typing  much  faster.  The  dataset  encompasses different  genres  curated  by  DDC.  The  dataset  consisted  of  10000sentences   and   4820   unique   words.   Next,   52150   sequences   were generated  using  N-gram  methods  followed  by  vectorizing  text  using embedding techniques. Different RNN-based models were evaluated for the next Dzongkha words prediction. Two Bi-LSTMlayerswith 512 hidden layer neurons gave the best accuracy of 73.89% with a loss of 1.0722. </td>

      <td>The world has been observing unprecedented circumstances with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
upsurge of infection cases has left hospitals overwhelmed, education quality compromised, caused unemployment issues, and 
affected the international economy, tourism sector, and financial markets. The number of confirmed cases and deaths has been 
increasing on daily basis. However, a vaccination drive has been conducted globally to reduce the transmission. The purpose of 
this study was to present the basic system configuration of the Big Data technology called Spark and to performe an analysis of 
Thailand’s COVID-19 pandemic data. Data were collected from an open Thai government data center between January 2020 and 
28. May 2021. Bangkok province has the most COVID-19 cases followed by Samut Sakhon province. It has been observed that 
the ages between 20 and 40 were the most infected by COVID-19 in Thailand</td>

Similarly, most of the syllables and words require several keypresses. To date, the study on syllable prediction has not been done. Moreover, the lack of text corpus poses a challenge.
